Basics:
1. Create a basic project with no source
2. Run SBT (in a console in console mode) and then run:
    - tasks to see the available tasks
    - compile and show that the classes are compiled into target
    - note that they are all in a scala 2.9.2 directory
    - run package and note the name of the jar file
    - run clean to start again
3. Talk through the fact that SBT is a simple bootstrap and then show the executable.  Look up the fact that the sbt jar is downloaded.  Create a dir called project and in there pop a build.properties: [sbt.version=0.12.2]
    - restart sbt and see the download
    - then increament to a version that does not exist and restart .. note the failures
    - put it back to 0.12.2
4. Now go into the .sbt files in the root of the project:
    - create a file called build.sbt
    - add some attributes [name, version, scalaVersion] using :=
    - note the line separators
    - restart the console
    - now do a full packge and go through the jar and its contents
5. Now lets create a test:
    - create a directory src/test/java
    - in there pop a test class Footest.java
    - see it fail due to lack of dependencies
    - now open up the build.sbt and add in a dependencu with
        [libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "1.9.1"]
Now we have a running test.
